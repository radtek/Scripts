2.0 Notes
This is the first release.  Installation is easy. Connect as sysdba and run 
create_information_schema.sql.  This creates a user named information_schema
with the password information_schema.  As infoormation_schema, run the rest of
the scripts.

I'd recommend changing the password after you install the scripts.  You may even
want to lock the account.  If you ever want to (easily) upgrade (to add new 
views and such) do not create any object in this new schema.  The upgrade will 
drop the schema and recreate it.

Documentation for these views will be coming soon.  In the meantime, the web has 
plenty of documentation to describe them.
